Market Pegged Assets
********************

Market Pegged Assets are a class of financial instruments available on the
Transnet network. They implement a fungible, smart *contract for difference*
where one party gets stability with respect to an underlying asset and the other
gets leverage against another digital asset that servers as backing collateral
for the first.
